# Prime-Number-Checker
This Java program checks for prime number within 100 digits of each other starting at 1 - 100 and asks the user whether they would like to continue before adding another 100 digits onto the new figures. 

This can also be easily stopped and adapted to start off with a higher number or can be set to display more prime numbers greater than just displaying 100. For example 1,000,000 or more which may become difficult to look at in the console. 

I can try to fix this problem by finding a different way to display the numbers such as with J-Frame or by creating a new line for every 20 or so numbers.
